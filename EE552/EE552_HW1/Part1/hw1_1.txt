out1
Each  cycle  of  this  always  block  takes  ____5_____  time  units. 
Therefore,  if  the  value  of in changes  slower,  lets  say  at  each  10  time units, 
the always block will ___ see___ all those events during the time  it  is  busy  
in  one  cycle!  This models  the transport delay of  the block,  where  any  pulse  on a
will  be  accepted  and __will not__ affect the output.
out2
Each  cycle  of  this  always  block  takes  ____15_____  time  units. 
Therefore,  if  the  value  of in changes  faster,  lets  say  at  each  10  time units, 
the always block will ___miss___ all those events during the time  it  is  busy  
in  one  cycle!  This models  thetransportdelayof  the block,  where  any  pulse  on a
will  be  accepted  and __will__ affect the output.
out3
Each  cycle  of  this  always  block  takes  ____5_____  time  units. 
Therefore,  if  the  value  of achanges  slower,  lets  say  at  each  10  time units, 
the always block will ___see ___ all those events during the time  it  is  busy  
in  one  cycle!  This models  theinertial  delayof  the block  in  that  pulses  less  
than  5 time  unit on a are  rejected  and __will_not__affect the output.
out4
Each  cycle  of  this  always  block  takes  ____15_____  time  units. 
Therefore,  if  the  value  of achanges  faster,  lets  say  at  each  10  time units, 
the always block will ___ miss___ all those events during the time  it  is  busy  
in  one  cycle!  This models  theinertial  delayof  the block  in  that  pulses  less  
than  2000 time  unit on aare  rejected  and __will__affect the output.

Each  cycle  of  this  always  block  takes  ____0_____  time  units. 
Therefore,  if  the  value  of achanges  slower,  lets  say  at  each  10  time units,
